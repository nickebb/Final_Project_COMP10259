				<li>Weight & Size: (3.6-5.4)kg & (71-76)cm</li>
				<li>Found in:Vattern,Lake Onega,Loch Ness,Lake Ontario</li>
				<li>Taxonomy: Order Salmonifoomes(Salmons & relatives),family Salmonidae(Trouts & Salmons)</li>
				<br>

					<li>Distribution & Habitat</li><br>
					<p>Atlantic salmon naturally spawn in the rivers of Europe and the northeastern coast of North America. Atlantic salmon is still present over all of Europe, from Russia in the north to Spain in the south. Due to sport fishing, some of the species' southern populations are dwindling in northern Spain.Climate and freshwater environmental changes have a direct impact on how organisms are distributed. Fish that live in cold water, like Atlantic salmon, are particularly sensitive to changes in water temperature.
					Salmon hatchlings stay in the river where they were hatched for one to four years. The size at which they smoltify, or change from their stream-adapted camouflage of broad, grey patches to their sea-adapted camouflage of glistening sides, is around 15 centimetres (5.9 in). In order to adjust to the osmotic variations between their habitats in fresh water and the ocean, they also undergo a number of endocrinological modifications. The parr (young fish) start to swim with the current rather than against it once smoltification is finished. The fish are now referred to as smolts because to these behavioural changes. Surface currents help herring smolts in particular go to the ocean, where they eat plankton or fish fry from other species.
					After a year of healthy growth, they will return to their natal river by following the sea surface currents. Salmon float on top of the water's surface currents rather than travelling hundreds of miles at sea. They probably use scent to find their birth river, however this hasn't been verified. 5% or less Atlantic salmon enter the wrong river. The salmon's range is therefore determined by the river where it is born and the sea surface currents that move in a circle to connect to it.
					Wild salmon have been slowly decreasing from many rivers throughout the 20th century as a result of overfishing and habitat destruction.</p>
					<br>
					<li>Ecosystem</li>
					<ul><br>
						<li>Diet:</li>
						<p>
							After just a few days, young fish begin to eat. They start to hunt once the body finishes absorbing the yolk sac. Young animals first eat tiny invertebrates, but as they become older, they could start eating small fish. The hunt for substrate and current is now on. Salmon eggs have been known to be consumed. Pre-grilse eat a variety of organisms, including plankton-like euphausiids, amphipods, and decapods. Chironomids, black bugs, stone flies, caddis flies, and other terrestrial insects are some of their favoredÂ food sources.
						</p><br>
						<li>Behaviour:</li>
						<p>Fry and Parr are alleged to be possessive, however there is contradicting evidence to support this claim. Despite the fact that they occasionally behave violently towards one another, the social hierarchy is yet unclear. Particularly as they leave the estuary, a lot of individuals may be observed travelling in that direction towards the school.

							Adult Atlantic salmon are regarded to be far more aggressive and likely to attack other fish than other salmon.
						</p><br>
						<li>Life stages:</li>
						<p>
							Since most Atlantic salmon migrate anadromously, they spend the bulk of their time in saltwater, where they eat and develop. However, in order to procreate, adults travel back to the freshwater streams of their ancestors, where once the eggs hatch, the young go through a number of developmental phases.
                            Saltwater is not necessary for Atlantic salmon. Several populations of the species are dispersed over the Northern Hemisphere and are "landlocked" since they can only be found in freshwater. One such example is the existence of a population in Lake Ontario that has since gone extinct, but later research has revealed that they spent their whole life cycle inside the lake's watershed.The landlocked strains are usually referred to as "ouananiche" in North America.

						</p><br>
						<li>Breeding:</li>
						<p>
							Atlantic salmon breed in the rivers of Western Europe, stretching from northern Portugal to Norway, Iceland, and Greenland on the east coast of North America, from Connecticut in the United States north to northern Labrador and Arctic Canada.
                            In the gravel bed of the stream, the species creates a "redd" or nest. With her tail near to the gravel, the female creates a powerful water downdraft that creates a depression. The female fish again adjusts gravel with her tail, trying to hide the eggs and milt that she and a male fish produced upstream of the depression, respectively, and that had been caught in it.
							The Atlantic salmon is iteroparous, which means that although though it usually only spawns once or twice, it may recover and return to the sea multiple times to resume its migratory and spawning cycle. On the other hand, several semelparous species of Pacific salmon die after spawning. Repeat spawners are less common than normal since it costs them physiologically to relocate and spawn.
							Parr, fish that have spent one to five sea winters in the ocean, as well as longer sea ages, are included in the maturity ages of Atlantic salmon. This age range could exist in one community as a kind of "bet hedging" against shifts in stream flows. 
							Since certain fish of a certain age won't reproduce in a dry year, the next generation will have access to more rainy years.

					<li>Conservation</li>
					<p>
						This species, which is categorised as a common species, has a "least concern" conservation status according to the IUCN, which was last updated 25 years ago. According to a more recent regional assessment, the population of this species is fragile in Europe, and the situation may be the same or equivalent elsewhere in the world. The Inner Bay of Fundy population and the coastline of Maine have been classified as "endangered" populations under the Endangered Species Act and the Canadian Species at Risk Act, respectively, due to population declines that have been seen throughout the native range of the Atlantic salmon.
                        <br>
						<br>
						Human activities have an influence on salmon populations all across their range. Overfishing and habitat destruction are the two primary problems. Salmon populations in Lake Ontario have been falling since the 18th and 19th centuries as a result of logging, soil erosion, the construction of dams and mills, among other things. By 1896, the species had been designated as extinct in the lake.
                        The rates of Atlantic salmon mortality at sea in the western Atlantic more than quadrupled starting about 1990. Several river flows in Maine, southern New Brunswick, and mainland Nova Scotia saw substantial declines or completely disappeared. The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation conducted a global research as a result of the high mortality rate. In Canada's Newfoundland, the population of Atlantic salmon had significantly declined by the year 2000.The North Atlantic Salmon Fund was founded in 2007 to purchase commercial fishing quotas from commercial fisherman in the Atlantic in an effort to safeguard wild Salmo salar stocks. This happened when at least one sport fishing association from Scandinavia and Iceland claimed that overfishing at sea was to blame for the drop in recreational fishing.
						<br><br>
						Returns in 2008 were quite good, possibly as a result of improvements in the ocean's feeding grounds. Returns on the Penobscot River in Maine climbed from around 940 in 2007 by mid-July 2008. There were apparently similar tales about rivers that connected Newfoundland and Quebec. 2011 saw a record-breaking return of salmon to the Penobscot River of over 3,100, the highest number since 1986. In the Narraguagus River, the number of fish surged to around 200, up from low two digits barely a decade before.
						It is now legal to fish for stocked, landlocked Atlantic salmon for enjoyment in several of the US and Canadian provinces and states where it is common. However, these restrictions are in effect in a number of states and provinces to ensure the survival of the species. These regulations cover things like strict catch limits, catch and release policies, and necessary fly fishing. However, catch and release fishing has the potential to exacerbate the high levels of stress that Atlantic salmon populations are already experiencing as a result of climate change, overfishing, and predator pressure.
						<ul><li>Restoration Efforts</li></ul>
						<p>
							Salmon is progressively being reintroduced to its natural habitats around the North Atlantic. In this process, restoration and habitat preservation are essential, but there are other important factors to take into account, such as concerns about overfishing and competition from farmed and escaped salmon. The proportion of Atlantic salmon reproducing regularly after being returned to the Great Lakes is quite small. Most companies restock their inventory once every year. The state of New York has supplied its adjacent rivers and tributaries with Atlantic salmon since the fish disappeared from Lake Ontario in the late 19th century, and in many locations does not permit active fishing.
							<br>The Ontario government launched the Atlantic Salmon Restoration Programme in 2006, one of the biggest freshwater conservation initiatives in North America. Since then, it has increased yearly efforts and provided more than 6,000,000 juvenile Atlantic salmon to Lake Ontario and its tributaries.To bring salmon back to New England, efforts are still being made to remove old dams, erect fish ladders, and employ other methods that have been successful with Pacific salmon in the West. Up until now, population growth along the Connecticut and Penobscot Rivers has been moderately successful. Currently, Atlantic salmon may be present in Lake Champlain.
							The Atlantic Salmon Federation participates in restoration initiatives throughout the eastern coastlines of the US and Canada, where its efforts are concentrated on eliminating invasive species and impediments to fish movement.
